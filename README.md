# Group-Project-2
A group project for the SMU coding bootcamp, made to demonstrate knowledge of full stack applications, including node, express, and handlebars. 


This is a project designed to take input from the user on a variety of attributes related to videogames, such as its length, price, genre, etc.

It will then query a database with approximately 50 videogames, and return the 5 that match preferences most closely.

Each match will display video, description, a link to buy and other relevant info.

There will also be an option to subscribe and recieve emails when a videogame close to the user's preferences is input, and potentially more depth of information.

There will also be an about us page and user guide.
