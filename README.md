# Group-Project-2
A group project for the SMU coding bootcamp, made to demonstrate knowledge of full stack applications, including node, express, and handlebars.
This is a project designed to take input from the user on a variety of attributes related to videogames, such as its length, price, genre, etc.
Each match will display video, description, a link to buy and other relevant info.
There will also be an option to subscribe and recieve emails when a videogame close to the userâ€™s preferences is input, and potentially more depth of information.
